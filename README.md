## Future Plans

This project is just the beginning of a comprehensive personal finance application. Here are the planned enhancements:

1. **Advanced Goal Setting**:
   - Allow users to set financial goals, such as buying a house, car, or other high-value items.
   - Support goal prioritization and progress tracking.

2. **Time-Bound Savings Calculation**:

   - Adjust predictions dynamically based on changes in income, expenses, or savings behavior.

3. **Investment Module**:
   - Introduce investment options such as:
     - **Stocks**
     - **Bonds**
     - **Mutual Funds**
     - **Company-Specific Investments**
   - Predict the potential **risk of loss** or **profit** for investments based on historical market data, user preferences, and investment duration.

4. **Risk Analysis**:
   - Develop models to assess and predict financial risks for usersâ€™ investments.
   - Provide tailored advice based on risk tolerance.

5. **Interactive Data Visualizations**:
   - Use charts and graphs to display:
     - Savings trends.
     - Monthly expense breakdowns.
     - Investment growth over time.
   - Integrate libraries like **Plotly**, **Chart.js**, or **Matplotlib** for dynamic visuals.
